# We create fixed user accounts to provide an isolated execution environment to run the jupyter notebooks
# They are called studentXXX where XXX is comprised between USERMIN and USERMAX defined below poentially with the addition of an offset (UIDBASE) for their uid/gid
# Their home directory is located under /student and is thus named /student/studentXXX
# Corresponding JupyterHub accounts are also created
#
# USERMIN indicates the starting ID of the Linux and Jupyter user account range
#
USERMIN: 1
#
# USERMAX indicates the ending ID of the Linux and Jupyter user account range
#
USERMAX: 20
#
# UIDBASE is the offset used to create the Linux user account IDs
# Example when creating user 35 with UIDBASE of 2000, the uid created is 2035
#
UIDBASE: 2000
#
# GIDBASE is the offset used to create the Linux group IDs
# Example when creating user 35 with GIDBASE of 2000, the gid created is 2035
#
GIDBASE: 2000
#
# Setup CLEAN to true if you want all Liunx & Jupyter user accounts to be removed before ansible check
#
CLEAN: false
#
# VAULTPWD is the passwd used to manage the ansible vault
#
VAULTPWD: VeryComplexPasswd1234!
#
# NOCHECKSSH are ssh options used to dialog with appliances
# By default avoid checking Host keys and Host file as they may change on a regular base

# This variable is defined for ansible playbooks, do not change without knowing what you do
# This is the only one remaining, so we can easily overload it with -e for private script compilation e.g.
