#
# These variables are located lower in the ansible tree to allow different values required for different backends while keeping a single frontend
#
# BASESTDID is the offset used to create users in the DB. It is required that each backend has a different non overlapping value.
# Overlap is defined by BASESTDID + USERMAX (from all.yml)
#
# Example:
# for student 35 in location A having BASESTDID to 0 the user is created as id 35
# for student 35 in location B having BASESTDID to 2000 the user is created as id 2035
# There is no overlap as long as you do not create more than 2000 users which should be the value of USERMAX in that case.
#
# This is different from the offset UIDBASE used for Linux uid
#
BASESTDID: 0
#
# JPHUB  is the directory used to install the JupyterHub stack (a python venv)
#
JPHUB: /opt/jupyterhub
#
# In case we have a LDAP server to use, flag as such the corresponding workshops in the DB and use the following values:
#
LDAPSRVNAME: ldap.example.org
LDAPDMN: example.org
LDAPPWD: MotDePasseLDAPCompliqu√©Aussi123!!!##
LDAPPORT: "389"

# For various existing public WoDs - needed. Adapt but do not remove !
